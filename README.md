## Extending
To extend this lab, you will need to add the following:

Done - (2 marks) Add the ability to delete grades using the swiping gesture, then remove the delete icon from the appBar.

Done - (2 marks) Add the ability to edit grades using the long press gesture, with a popup menu, then remove the edit icon from the appBar.

Done - (2 marks) Add a single icon to the appBar that allows users to sort the grades in one of four ways (increasing/decreasing sid/grade).

Done - (2 marks) Add an icon to the appBar that shows a `DataTable`, which generates a vertical bar chart of the grade data. The Y axis should be frequency, and the X axis should be the grade in ascending order.

Done - (3 marks) Add an icon to the appBar that enables a user to import a .csv file from local files to populate the list of grades. The csv file should have 2 columns (sid, grade) and append all new grades to the existing list of grades.

Done - (4 marks) Add two more features of your choice other than those listed here. Mention these features explicitly in your README.md.
